# Feature Recommendation Summary

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the BG3ModMaker codebase, I've identified **10 potential features** that would enhance the modding experience. These features are documented in detail across two files:

- **`FEATURE_SUGGESTIONS.md`** - Complete list of 10 features with rationale
- **`TOP_3_FEATURES.md`** - Detailed implementation guide for the top 3 recommendations

---

## üèÜ Top 3 Recommendations

### 1. Lua Script Syntax Highlighting ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Value:** Critical for BG3's primary scripting language
- **Effort:** Low (1-2 hours)
- **Impact:** Immediate usability improvement
- **Status:** Ready to implement - Scintilla has built-in Lua support

### 2. Find/Replace Dialog ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Value:** Essential text editing feature currently missing
- **Effort:** Medium (4-6 hours)
- **Impact:** Major workflow improvement
- **Status:** Can leverage existing Scintilla infrastructure

### 3. Stats.txt Validator ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Value:** Prevents common modding errors
- **Effort:** Medium-High (6-8 hours)
- **Impact:** Reduces debugging time significantly
- **Status:** Requires custom parser but follows existing patterns

---

## Why These Three?

### Lua Highlighting - "Quick Win"
```
‚úì Leverages existing Scintilla lexer
‚úì Minimal code changes (~50 lines)
‚úì High user-facing value
‚úì No external dependencies
```

### Find/Replace - "Missing Essential"
```
‚úì Expected feature in any text editor
‚úì Uses Scintilla's search API
‚úì Improves productivity immediately
‚úì Follows existing dialog patterns
```

### Stats Validator - "Error Prevention"
```
‚úì Unique value proposition
‚úì Reduces trial-and-error cycles
‚úì Educational for new modders
‚úì Extensible for future stat types
```

## Other Valuable Features

### Medium Priority
4. **Diff Viewer** - Compare LSX/LSF files side-by-side
5. **Bookmark System** - Quick access to frequently used files
6. **PAK Comparison** - Compare two PAK files for differences

### Lower Priority
7. **LSX/LSF Context Menu** - Convenience feature (functionality exists)
8. **Auto-complete** - Requires index to be populated
9. **Enhanced Loca Editor** - Specialized use case
10. **Git Integration** - Users may prefer external tools

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. Implement **Lua Syntax Highlighting**
   - Test with sample BG3 Lua scripts
   - Document in README

### Phase 2: Core Editing (Week 2)
2. Implement **Find/Replace Dialog**
   - Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+F, Ctrl+H)
   - Support regex and case-sensitive search
   - Test with large files (Stats.txt, LSX)

### Phase 3: Validation (Week 3-4)
3. Implement **Stats.txt Validator**
   - Create parser for Stats.txt format
   - Define validation rules for common stat types
   - Integrate with OutputWindow for error display
   - Add "Validate" button/menu item to editor

---

## Technical Considerations

### Existing Infrastructure to Leverage
- **Scintilla** - Text editor with extensive language support
- **WTL/ATL** - Dialog and UI framework already in use
- **ModelessDialog** - Base class for tool windows
- **OutputWindow** - For displaying validation results
- **DocStyler pattern** - Extensible styling system

### Code Consistency
All implementations follow:
- Modern C++ (C++20)
- WTL/ATL patterns
- Existing project structure
- RAII and smart pointers
- Exception handling conventions

---

## Expected Outcomes

### User Benefits
- **Lua Highlighting**: Better code readability, fewer syntax errors
- **Find/Replace**: Faster file navigation, bulk text operations
- **Stats Validator**: Catch errors early, learn correct format

### Developer Benefits
- Clean, maintainable code following project patterns
- Minimal dependencies (leverage existing libraries)
- Extensible architecture (easy to add more stylers, validators)

---

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Why Not Other Features First?

**Git Integration** - Adds complexity, users have good external tools  
**Auto-complete** - Requires populated Xapian index, more complex UI  
**Enhanced Loca Editor** - Narrow use case, existing functionality works  

The top 3 features provide **maximum value with minimum complexity** and address **current gaps** in the tool's functionality.

---

## Conclusion

**Recommended Order:**
1. Start with **Lua Highlighting** (quick win, validates approach)
2. Add **Find/Replace** (essential feature users expect)
3. Build **Stats Validator** (unique value, showcase differentiator)

This progression:
- Builds confidence with easy success
- Delivers immediate user value
- Culminates in a standout feature

**Total Estimated Time:** 2-3 weeks for all three features

Each feature is well-scoped, follows existing patterns, and provides clear value to BG3 modders. The detailed implementation guides in `TOP_3_FEATURES.md` provide code examples and step-by-step instructions to get started immediately.
