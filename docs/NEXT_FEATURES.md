This directory contains comprehensive feature recommendations for BG3ModMaker's future development.

## ðŸ“š Documentation Overview

### Start Here
- **[FEATURE_RECOMMENDATION_SUMMARY.md](../FEATURE_RECOMMENDATION_SUMMARY.md)** - Executive summary with recommendations

### Detailed Documents
- **[FEATURE_SUGGESTIONS.md](../FEATURE_SUGGESTIONS.md)** - All 10 feature ideas with priorities
- **[TOP_3_FEATURES.md](../TOP_3_FEATURES.md)** - Implementation guide for top 3 features

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Recommendation

If you want to add value quickly, implement in this order:

1. **Lua Syntax Highlighting** (1-2 hours) - Quick win
2. **Find/Replace Dialog** (4-6 hours) - Essential feature
3. **Stats.txt Validator** (6-8 hours) - Unique value

Each feature has detailed implementation examples with code snippets in the TOP_3_FEATURES.md document.

## ðŸ’¡ Why These Features?

- **Lua Highlighting**: BG3 uses Lua extensively, and syntax highlighting makes scripts much easier to read and write
- **Find/Replace**: Every text editor needs this - it's notably missing from the current tool
- **Stats Validator**: Helps modders catch errors before testing in-game, saving significant development time
